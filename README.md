## What is Guardian, and why was it created?
Guardian is a parental controls app for Android, originally made by an 11-year-old with a love for coding, and finding many ways to get past the controls used for his phone. He thought he could use the developer knowledge that he had and create a parental controls app, specifically one that works.
